                <p>This visualisation shows the percentage of electricity produced per source per country. The map provides an indication of what proportion comes from renewable sources such as solar energy, wind and hydroelectric sources. The bar graph provides more detail as renewable energy is split over hydroelectric and the rest. However, this aspect of the visualisation also gives some more context as: it shows the other sources that are used in that specific country, it shows how much is unknown (by the top blue bar labeled: total % known) and it allows for comparisons across countries.</p>
