Explain the difference between the == operator and the === operator.
    The == operator compares the variables and checks if they are the same without
    checking is the type of these variables is the same.
    The === operator does check for this.

Explain what a closure is. (Note that JavaScript programs use closures very often.)
    Closure is the ability to reference a specific instance of local variables in
    an enclosing function. The declaration of the inner function 'freezes' the code and
    wraps it in the function value that is returned. If this is stored in a variable,
    this variable can be used as the function, unfreezing the corresponding code.

Explain what higher order functions are.
    They are functions that operate on other functions. For example, functions that
    change other functions or even create new functions. Just like normal functions
    they declutter your code as they allow for an increased level of abstraction:
    instead of writing several lines of code it allows you to use the relevant word
    used to describe the function.

Explain what a query selector is and give an example line of JavaScript that uses
a query selector.
    This is a method that takes a selector string and - in the case of 'querySelectorAll'
    returns an array-like object that contains all matching elements (not unlike
    the getElementByTag selectors from the python pattern library except that it
    is not live). The 'querySelector' method (without the 'All') only returns the
    first matching element.
