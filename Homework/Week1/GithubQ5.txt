5. What is a so called “branch” in Git terms and why would you use it.Branches allow you to safely experiment with making changes.Git stores data as a series of snapshots; when you commit, Git stores a commitobject that contains a pointer to the corresponding snapshot and some otherdata: pointers to the direct parents of the commit and the author and metadata.A branch is a pointer to one of the commits.Default is master and everytime you commit, it moves forward automatically.Making a new branch is effectively, making a new pointer to a snapshot.It is useful when you're working on a large project and notice something vitalyou need/want to fix. You can make a new branch and merge the branches whenyou're done to continue working where you left off before. Also it allows youto quickly switch between different parts of your project.
